# JavaScript Graph Library for Hierarchical Structures

This library is a comprehensive solution for managing and visualizing node relationships in hierarchical data structures. It's particularly optimized for handling GCP permission data, allowing easy manipulation and querying of complex relationships.

## Features

- **Node Management**: Efficiently create and manage nodes with unique identifiers and types.
- **Edge Linking**: Define relationships between nodes with roles, capturing complex hierarchical data.
- **Ancestor Tracking**: Maintain and retrieve ancestor information for each node, crucial for understanding inherited permissions.
- **JSON Data Integration**: Seamlessly build and populate the graph from JSON data, particularly tailored for GCP permission structures.

## Getting Started

To use this library, clone the repo and include the main classes in your project.
